### Synthetic Data Generation

 A) LHS was used to sample the four parameter input space ( $\delta y$, $W$, $H$, and $\mu$) for the neo-Hookean material model, and five parameter input space ( $\delta y$, $W$, $H$, $\mu$, and $Jm$) for the Gent material model to generate a FE input file. 
 
 B) The FE input file was fed into the implicit mixed FE model (C) to generate a load-displacement curve output, FE output file. 
 
 (A-C) represents the forward problem, while the inverse problem, determining material parameters from experimental data, is accomplished through the use of two machine learning models.
